        How Otter Works
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Overview
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Otter Protocol is a client/server protocol suite for authenticating username-password combinations to a database or 
        file of existing entries. In this protocol, servers are known as Otter servers or 'otservers' and clients are Otter 
        clients or 'otclients'. Otclients first tether with an otserver via tethering packets (TREQ, TREN, TACK, TPRV, TINV) and communicate via credential packets (CSEND, 
        CVAL, CINV) to check if a username-password combination exists in the database handled by the otserver.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Client Tethering
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before communication can take place between an otserver and otclient, the otclient must first establish tethering
        with the otserver. Tethering allows the otserver to validate and register the details of an otclient with an
        expiry time. This can be done by performing a tether request/tether acknowledge (TREQ/TACK) handshake which will 
        be discussed in detail under the section <a href="ot_packets.h">Otter Packets</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Otter Files (Otfiles) and Otter Servers (Otservers)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Otter servers (otservers) utilize a specific file called the Otter file (otfile, with .ot
        extension) that contains the database of username-password combinations. Otservers construct a hash set out of the
        otfile entries by computing each entry into a hash digest. This hash set is known as a Otter table or 'otable' which
        is part of the server runtime object called the 'server context' to be discussed further in the 
        section <a href="ot_contexts.html">Client/Server Contexts</a>. All subsequent otclient transactions with the otserver
        revolves around cross-checks with the otable.
