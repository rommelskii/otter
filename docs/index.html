        Purpose
      </h2>
      <p>
        This project's purpose is for me to understand software design & maintenance, network and socket programming, and 
        memory handling. So far, this project has taught me how to observe memory safety while also creating dynamic
        data structures for representing requests, databases, and the transformations between information. This project
        was never meant to be utilized by the public, but this is open for all people to utilize should they intend to 
        build over this protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first personal project that I took seriously and professionally. The rest of my projects before
        have been experimental, i.e., were for learning and bearing not much fruit. For the Otter Protocol, however, 
        it had an aspect that was not present in my other projects which was the satisfaction of tinkering around deep
        into the computer's memory. I love programming in C. I've always heard about the magical powers of C and its 
        responsibility of being one of the forefathers of modern computing. Every time I continue on with this project, 
        the more I realize what the early developers felt with this programming language.

        Regarding this documentation
      </h2>
      <p>
        Instead of utilizing an external library for creating dynamic documentation and fancy formatting, I took this
        opportunity to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript by creating this from scratch!
